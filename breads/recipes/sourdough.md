# Basic Sourdough Bread

Recipe for basic 1 day sourdough bread. Start this recipe early in the morning for bread by dinner.
### Ingredients 
- Levain
	- *2 tablespoons* Active sourdough starter
	- *3 tablespoons* Warm water (90-100 degrees farenheight)
	- *1/3 cup* Bread Flour
- Dough
	- *1 levain*
	- *4 cups* bread flour
	- *1 tbsp* kosher salt
	- *1.5 cups* warm water
### Instructions
1. Mix ingredients for levain into mixing bowl, cover with dish towel, and let rest at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. At the end of this process, there should be bubbles starting to poke through the top of the mixture and it should have grown slightly.
2. Take Levithan and add  1.25 cups of warm water. Mix thoroughly.
3. Add 3.5 cups of the bread flour to the mixture, adding about 1 cup at a time, mixing in with hand and integrate into a homogenous mixture.
4. Let mixture sit covered with dish towel at room temperature for about a half hour.
5. Add remaining 0.25 cup of water and the kosher salt to the mixture, and integrate thoroughly with hand.
6. Let dough sit covered with dish towel at room temperature for about a half hour
7. Stretch and fold dough 4 times in four directions.
8. Follow the previous two instructions until about 3 or 4 hours has gone by. This process will allow yeast to grow in activity within the dough while also developing air pockets and gluten strands.
9. Take dough out of the bowl and rest on a floured surface. Grabbing one side, pull toward you and fold forward onto itself. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat. This process develops tension on the underside, which will be the top of the loaf. Once this is done, rest in a proofing basket for 30 to 45 minutes to do another rise.
10. Set oven to 500 degrees farenheight and once it reaches temperature, throw a dutch oven in to heat up for 20 minutes before removing.
11. Score top of dough in typical criss-cross, and dust with semolina flour if desired.
12. Place dough ball into parchment paper, and place paper into the dutch oven. Place lid on dutch oven.
13. Set oven to 450 degrees farenheight, and immediately bake dutch oven for 25 minutes.
14. After 25 minutes, remove lid, and bake for 15 to 20 more minutes to develop brown color on top.
15. Take out of oven, and let cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.
